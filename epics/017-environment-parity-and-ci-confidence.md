# EPIC-017 — Environment parity + CI confidence (reduce manual Replit validation)

**Status:** Deferred  
**Owner:** Wilson / Codex / Claude  
**Created:** 2026-05-05  
**Updated:** 2026-05-05  

## One-line summary

Capture the decisions + open questions required to make local + CI validation trustworthy enough that manual Replit validation is no longer the default merge gate.

## Context — why this exists

Today, LAICA uses a manual “Replit validation gate” because local macOS runs and Replit runs can diverge (runtime, env vars, database, OAuth domains, etc.). This creates friction and correctness ambiguity: “it worked locally” does not reliably imply “it will work on Replit deploy.”

This epic exists to preserve the decision points and intended direction so we can resume after the current initiative work (INIT-001) without re-deriving this context from chat.

Primary spec / drift-vector inventory:
- `docs/workflows/environment-parity-spec.md`

Key external constraints (provenance):
- Replit SQL DB `DATABASE_URL` is app-scoped and cannot be used externally, so “use the same Replit DB from local” is not a viable parity strategy:
  - https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/storage-and-databases/replit-database
- Replit has separate development vs production databases; publishing/deploy uses production DB:
  - https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/storage-and-databases/create-production-database-when-publishing
- Firebase Auth Emulator issues unsigned tokens; Admin SDK accepts them only when `FIREBASE_AUTH_EMULATOR_HOST` is set (must never be set in production):
  - https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/connect_auth
- Firebase OAuth redirect domains: whitelisting is domain-based (any port on that domain):
  - https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/6400741?hl=en
- Identity Platform `accounts:createAuthUri` can generate an authorization URI for a providerId like `google.com` (useful for a “OAuth can start” preflight check):
  - https://cloud.google.com/identity-platform/docs/reference/rest/v1/accounts/createAuthUri
- Node 20 is EOL 2026-04-30; Node 22 is supported until 2027-04-30:
  - https://github.com/nodejs/Release

## Scope

### In scope

- Define minimal parity invariants (runtime + install + env contract + DB schema parity + auth parity).
- Define what CI must prove so “passes in CI” implies “safe to deploy to Replit” (with explicit exceptions).
- Define how local/CI can use Firebase Auth Emulator while still ensuring prod Google OAuth doesn’t silently break.
- Define DB parity where schema and semantics are identical but instances/users/data differ per environment.

### Out of scope (for now)

- Implementing automated tests / CI gates (deferred until after INIT-001).
- Changing `AGENTS.md` / ADR-0001 to remove the Replit validation gate (requires an explicit follow-up decision).

## Decisions made so far

These are recorded from discussion; they are not yet implemented repo-wide.

1. **Parity definition target:** Behavioral parity (same semantics/contracts), not bitwise OS parity.
2. **Runtime direction:** Standardize on Node 22 LTS (Node 20 is EOL as of 2026-04-30).
3. **DB parity stance:** Different DB instances/users/data per env is OK; schema + migration posture must match.
4. **Local/CI auth lane:** Prefer Firebase Auth Emulator for deterministic local/CI auth.
5. **“Real login works” definition:** Prefer an automated “OAuth can start on prod domain” preflight check, not an automated full Google sign-in completion (avoid test-account credential/2FA brittleness).

## Open questions

1. Which domain(s) are “production hostnames” for the OAuth-domain preflight gate?
   - Replit deployment domain(s) only vs custom domain only vs both
2. Should the preflight gate run on every PR merge, only on release, or as a nightly canary?
3. CI DB approach: Neon Local vs ephemeral Postgres vs other — and how schema health is enforced.
4. How should this epic’s direction reconcile with current workflow docs that state Replit is the service-backed validation gate (ADR-0001 / `AGENTS.md` / EPIC-005 / EPIC-010)?

## Agent checklist — when to read this epic

Read EPIC-017 before:

- Changing `.replit`, runtime pins, or install/run commands
- Changing auth flows (Firebase client config, token verification, domain requirements)
- Changing DB schema/migration posture or local DB setup defaults
- Changing app-wide merge validation policy (CI vs Replit gate)

Also read:
- `epics/005-testing-strategy-and-acceptance-criteria.md`
- `epics/010-local-db-schema-strategy.md`

## Resolution criteria — what "done" looks like

This epic should remain `Deferred` until `initiatives/INIT-001-mobile-refresh.md` is complete.

This epic can be `Resolved` when all of the following are true:

1. CI is the primary merge gate for correctness (with explicit exceptions documented).
2. Local + CI run a repeatable authenticated smoke path (emulator-based) and DB schema health checks.
3. A prod OAuth-domain preflight gate exists (automated) and prevents `auth/unauthorized-domain` regressions.
4. `AGENTS.md` + ADR-0001 + EPIC-005/010 are updated so policy is consistent everywhere.

## 2026-05-05 — Parked

Deferred until after `initiatives/INIT-001-mobile-refresh.md` is finished.
