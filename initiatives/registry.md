# Initiative Registry

Complete searchable index of Laica INITs.

Default agent workflow:

- Start here or in the relevant INIT before resuming multi-phase work.
- Treat the INIT file as authoritative if this registry drifts.
- Update this registry when an INIT is created, changes status, changes active phase, or completes.

| INIT | Title | Status | Owner | Created | Current phase | Active PRs | Last signal |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [INIT-001](INIT-001-mobile-refresh.md) | Mobile Refresh | `In Progress` | Wilson / Codex / Claude / Replit | 2026-04-29 | Phase 3.1 / Phase 4 planning | None | PR #175 merged the accepted Ticket Pass hierarchy retry as `6510860` after Wilson's targeted Replit smoke and GitHub `unit`, `e2e_guest_smoke`, `npm-audit`, `trufflehog_pr`, and CodeQL passed at head `100cbd66`. The recipe suggestions now read more like a connected pass stack while preserving stable in-place selection and Prep Tray continuity. Next Phase 3.1 work should choose a different documented slice: light Prep Tray alignment, Planning toast cleanup, ingredient chip unification, async imagery, or closeout visual review. |
| [INIT-002](INIT-002-ai-error-telemetry.md) | AI Error Telemetry & Eval Monitoring | `In Progress` | Wilson / Codex / Claude / Replit | 2026-05-07 | Phase 2 — Replit observation week | None | PR #159 merged as `382ebd0` on 2026-06-10, shipping request IDs, a server-side classifier/logger, and 9 AI route catch blocks with no DB persistence. Final head `76b5361` passed local checks, GitHub unit/E2E/security, and direct Replit shell/browser validation without Replit Agent. Next: observe real Replit AI/speech/secrets behavior before Phase 3 schema work. |
| [INIT-003](INIT-003-anonymous-trial-and-account-upgrade.md) | Anonymous Trial and Account Upgrade | `In Progress` | Wilson / Codex / Claude / Replit | 2026-05-15 | Phase 5 / later promotion follow-up planning | None | PR #156 merged the guest bottom-nav correction as `492b3a6`: the unapproved `Save progress` shortcut is removed while menu/planning promotion paths remain. The first Phase 4 promotion slice remains merged via PR #126 (`8282d51`), and future guest cook/History import still waits for Phase 5/later promotion planning after INIT-001 Phase 5. |
| [INIT-004](INIT-004-ai-output-quality-evals.md) | AI Output Quality Evals & Prompt Improvement | `In Progress` | Wilson / Codex / Claude / Replit | 2026-06-09 | Phase 2 - rubric and dataset spec (drafting) | [#168](https://github.com/wmishak404/laica/pull/168) draft | Phase 2 draft spec proposes the eval-vs-prompt feature taxonomy split, first-class `pantry_recipes` and `slop_bowl` eval surfaces, privacy/source posture, criterion labels, fixture format, and first Wilson-label target set before harness code. |
